This project is not currently a 5.3 project. The effort of this project is to make available some of the tools and technologies that some of it's authors have been using for many years in a stable documented form as it may help others. 

If you are looking for a modern PHP5.3 framework, we recommend you look to Symfony2, it has everything you need and there is no real need to work with other home-brewed frameworks.
